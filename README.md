# TaskForge Backend

This project is part of my journey to improve and grow as a Spring Boot developer.

I keep learning new things every day, so I update this project regularly with new features, database improvements, and better code structure. It’s still a work in progress, and every commit represents a new step in my learning path.

### Current Features
- Basic Task management (Add, Update, Delete, View)
- Database integration
- Simple REST API using Spring Boot

### Future Improvements
- Full Authentication & Authorization
- Better API structure & error handling
- Logging and validation
- Frontend integration later

I appreciate any feedback. Development continues...
